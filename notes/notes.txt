TODO:

	SFX/Music!!!!!!

	Decide on a name
		And theme? Cat faces or something?

	Set up preloaded snood
		And robot helper animation

	Better art/animations in general
		Make own or use assets?
		At least do little robot reloader thing.

	Random levels (with seed)
		Show seed on board/let users choose seed.
		Separate High scores for random?
		Have difficulties?
			Separate high scores for them too?
			Difficulty affects:
				Width of board
				Rate of fill for danger bar
				Frequency of powerups/bad snoods
				Have an auto-shoot timer on hard difficulties.

	Danger bar
		Lowering screen

	Death menu

	Unbreakable pieces
		Do rocks or something instead of skulls so the bad snoods can use that.

	Make guide-line for aiming
		Have option to turn it on/off in options menu.

	Win level screen

	Win game screen

	High scores
		Leaderboard online

	Snoods used

	Score
		What formula/system?
		Imitate original scoring
		Snoods used for end level bonus
		Flat completion bonus

	NECESSARY FOR JAM:
		NEW THING:
			Powerup snoods - Hit them and they give you some powerup.
				- Knock down surrounding snoods
				- Give you a bomb to shoot
				- Give you a guideline for rest of level (or a few shots?)
				- ???
			Bad snoods - Opposite of powerups.
				- Instantly drop the wall down a notch
				- Pop up random new snoods around the board
				- Fuck up your aim for the next shot
					Random direction instead of where you point. Could have the gun start randomly wobbling back and forth at random speed so it's hard to shoot.


Probably not enough time:

	Do interactive soundtrack.
		Have song separated out into different tracks.
		Start with just light sounds, like flutes or whatever.
		As the board gets closer to the bottom, add more intense tracks, like drums and bass and scary sounds.
		Maybe even have a beat switch from a cute little nintendoey swing bop to a doomy thumping beat.
